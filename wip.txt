Hewwo! I'm Furdox :3
I'm a 17 years old tech enjoyer that mostly plays Mario Kart DS (link to wikipedia) ([I'm top 500]) and Super Animal Royale, but I don't game much, I mostly hangout on Discord and do wierd shenanigans.
I play a lot of different games though, mostly rhythm games when it comes to variety. Friend me on Steam :3
I also sometimes draw silly cats which you can see [on my Discord server].
I also have Autism and ADHD which may explain some of my actions.
I also have a website but that currently redirects to here so meowdy people coming from http://furdox.tk/ >//w//<
